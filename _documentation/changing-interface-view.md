<strong>Kanban Board View</strong>

While list and thumbnail view modes are designed for displaying the information, kanban board view allows user not just to see the data, but it is a functional tool for content management. Thanks to kanban board view in EasyERP user is able to manage company’s affairs, for example, it allows to change the status of an application, manage tasks and so on straight away on a kanban board. It combines both illustrative and intelligible display of data and allows to manage items with the help of drag-and-drop.

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/123.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/123.png" alt="kanban board view" width="800" height="373" /></a>

Kanban board view is accessible in such EasyERP’s menus as Opportunities, Tasks and Applications.

You may switch a page to a kanban board view by clicking  button, which is located opposite to a menu’s header:

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/123-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-908" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/123-2.png" alt="menu heading-2" width="800" height="25" /></a>

In the header row of each column you may see features which are aimed to make work with this tool even more simple, intuitive and comfortable:

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/123-3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/123-3.png" alt="column header" width="800" height="308" /></a>

There is the special field "0" (when column is displayed in full-size and when minimized) to show the number of items in each kanban’s column. Also there is a <strong>&lt;</strong> button to minimize this or that column.

Working with a kanban board user has a possibility to change properties of an item just by dragging it from one column of the board to another. For example, in such way you may change stage of opportunity from new one to qualification, proposition, won or lost. In the same way it is possible to change applicant’s or task’s status. Moreover, everything can be easily customized through settings menu screen of EasyERP.

It enhances user’s experience by combining illustrative and functional features within one and the same tool.

<strong>Thumbnail View</strong>

Thumbnail view is a easy-to-use, comfortable multimedia panel, which is aimed to simplify and improve user’s experience of working with data.

It is common for people to associate certain image with data referring to it: photo with a person, logo with a company, image with a product and so on.  That is the reason thumbnail view combines text information with images. It enhances usability and comfort of working with different data by visualizing it.

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/116.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-883" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/116.png" alt="talent management" width="800" height="358" /></a>

Many menus of EasyERP can be displayed in thumbnail view to simplify working with multiple data via visual perception, e.g. Persons, Companies, Employees, Products, etc.

You may switch to thumbnail view of the menus where it is accessible by clicking button, which is located opposite to the menu screen’s heading.

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/122.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-902" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/122.png" alt="menu heading" width="800" height="25" /></a>

If not all items are displayed and ones needed are not shown, you may open more items with the help of "Show More" button located at the bottom of the page.

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/122-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/122-2.png" alt="show more bottom" width="800" height="370" /></a>
<p class="normal" style="margin-left: 0cm;"><span lang="UK">Clicking on an item’s name or image in the thumbnail view opens the page of this item (e.g. clicking on employee’s photo or name opens his or her profile page).</span></p>
<p class="normal" style="margin-left: 0cm;"><strong>List View</strong></p>
List view is one of the most usual and traditional types of information display for users. It consists of information rows shown in a certain order, when items are followed one by another. In fact, it is a vertical scrolling list of items.

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/121.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-890" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/121.png" alt="list view" width="800" height="371" /></a>

In EasyERP many menus may be displayed in the list view mode, e.g. Tasks, Employees, Persons, Companies, Leads, etc.

You may switch this or that screen to the list view by clicking button located opposite to the menu screen’s title:

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/121-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-892" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/121-2.png" alt="screen title right" width="800" height="27" /></a>

You may configure the properties of the list view due to your needs and preferences by changing the number of items shown per page: choose whether 5, 10, 20, 50 or 100 items should be displayed at the page.

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/121-3.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-893 size-thumbnail" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/121-3-150x150.png" alt="items per page" width="150" height="150" /></a>

Navigation through the list is simple and performed by scrolling pages and switching them in case, the total number of items exceeds the number of items, which may be shown per one page of the list.

Switch pages forward using <strong>&gt;</strong> button or go to the last page with <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> button, <strong>&lt;</strong> button switches to the previous page and the first page of the list is shown on clicking <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong>. Also you may choose the needed page manually by clicking the page field. This action will open the total list of pages available for display, where you may choose the one that is needed:

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/121-4.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-894 size-thumbnail" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/121-4-150x150.png" alt="pages displayed" width="150" height="150" /></a>

Both of these options (items per page and switching pages) are available at the bottom of the page under the list of items:

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/121-5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/121-5.png" alt="bottom numbers" width="800" height="370" /></a>

List view gives the option to choose one or a few items in a list with the help of checkboxes at the beginning of each row.

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/121-6.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-896" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/121-6.png" alt="checkboxes" width="800" height="198" /></a>

Also all items on the page may be selected at once by putting a tick in the checkbox of the term row.

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/121-7.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-897" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/121-7.png" alt="select tick" width="800" height="20" /></a>

One more possibility the list view offers is sorting of items in accordance to a certain criteria. To do it you have to click on the heading of a column in the header row of a list. E.g. in Persons menu’s list view mode you may sort items due to person’s first and last name, email, phone, country, or the user which created the person or edited the profile information last time. Note, the criteria differ in each menu screen.

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/121-8.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/121-8.png" alt="criteria" width="800" height="17" /></a>

If any of criteria is selected, it is marked by <strong>∧</strong> or <strong>∨</strong> signs depending on the method of sorting.

You may open the page of a separate item by clicking on it in the list (e.g. open employee’s profile or product’s description).

List view is a simple but at the same time comfortable mode to display the information familiar practically to everyone.
