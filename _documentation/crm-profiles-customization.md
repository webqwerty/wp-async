EasyERP allows you to create types of profiles with different level of access to the functions of the system. It allows to build secure and simple database, where each user, depending on his status, position, etc., will be able to view, edit and delete certain kinds of data.

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/341.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1070" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/341.png" alt="managing profiles" width="800" height="264" /></a>

Thanks to this feature, you may not only improve confidentiality and security of the data, but also make a working process of the employees more comfortable and intelligible, as they will work with exactly that information, they need to operate with.

Ticks in the checkboxes indicate the rights of access available for a certain profile at the moment. These access rights cannot be edited straight away in a view mode.

Configuring process is also user-friendly and does not require any special knowledge: everything is configured with the help of checkboxes in appropriate fields.

<strong>Navigation in “Profiles” menu</strong>

Navigation in this section of “Settings” is roughly the same as in “Workflows” menu: needed option’s settings are selected and opened via side menu.

E.g. when a you need to view or edit access settings for the admin profile, you have to hover over “admin Profile” option in side menu and click on it to open access settings of very this group of users.

In each profile’s tab you may see general list of access settings to EasyERP’s sections. If you need more detailed list, click on the item to view a complete set of features available for each section. To minimize the list click on an item again.

<strong>Add profiles</strong>

You may create as many profile types as you need and set different access rights to each of them. Adding a group may be done in a few simple steps:
<ol>
 	<li>Press the “Add” button <strong>+</strong>, located in the top left corner of the screen.</li>
 	<li>Previous action opens the menu for creating a group, where you may insert data about the profile:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li>Profile Name - textfield to enter the name of a profile. It should contain two or more symbols and cannot be empty.</li>
 	<li>Description - textfield to enter a description for a profile.</li>
 	<li>Use base profile and edit privileges - checkbox, with the help of which you may create a profile, access rights of which will be the same as existing profiles group possess and may be edited after saving.</li>
 	<li>Base Profile - choose a profile, access rights of which will be used as the basis for newly created one (if “Use base profile and edit privileges” option is chosen).</li>
 	<li>Create new profile from scratch - checkbox, with the help of which you may create a profile, access rights of which will be empty and may be edited after saving.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Create - clicking here, you will create a new profile with all the information given above.</li>
</ol>

Cancel - after clicking here, all the information given will be lost and the profile will not be created.

<strong>Editing profile</strong>

Access rights of each profile may be changed without any difficulties whenever you need or want to. You should note, that when you open a tab of this or that profile, access rights cannot be edited straight away. To do editing the following actions should be performed.

1.  Choose a profile you need to edit in the side menu. Let’s take, for example, SalesAccount Profile, users related to which, as you may see, have full access to all sections of the system except for viewing, editing and deleting items in “Settings” menu screen.

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/341-6.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1076" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/341-6.png" alt="prodile settings" width="800" height="200" /></a>

2.  Click the “Edit” button in the top left corner of the screen next to “Add” button to set the editing mode active.

3.  You may edit profile’s name in the textfield in side menu "Sales account".

4.  Put or remove ticks in the checkboxes which refer to the appropriate sections of EasyERP you want to grant access to or deprive users having certain type of profile of.

5.  If you need more flexibility in settings (e.g. you need to deprive the SalesAccount profile of the right of access to all sections of HR menu screen except for “Employees” menu), click on the appropriate item (in this case “HR”) to open more detailed list of items referred to this section (to hide it clickon the item again).

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/341-7.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1077" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/341-7.png" alt="edit prodile" width="800" height="317" /></a>

6.  “Save” button - pressing this button you will save the changes to profile.

You should note, that when “Delete” access right are granted to this or that profile, it also gets rights to view and edit information. If “Write/Edit” access is granted, the right to view info is set automatically.

<strong>Delete profiles</strong>

You also may delete profiles from the database. To delete a profile the following sequence of action is required:
<ol>
 	<li>Choose a needed profile from the list in the side menu of “Profiles” menu screen.</li>
</ol>

2.  Click the “Delete” button , located in the top left corner of the screen next to the “Edit” button in the view mode or next to the “Save” button in editing mode.

3.  After you have clicked the “Delete” button, an alert message appears, where you may confirm or cancel the action.
