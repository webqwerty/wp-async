HrDashboard is a simple and convenient HR software module to monitor overall situation with your staff. It shows you, which employees have been hired and fired per each month and their total number.

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/235.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/235.png" alt="HR dashboard" width="800" height="256" /></a>

In a header row you may see, to which month and year each column refers (the last column shows the current month):

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/235-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1008" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/235-2.png" alt="HR header" width="800" height="20" /></a>

Header columns show you the name of a row in a table:

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/235-3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1009" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/235-3.png" alt="HR table" width="169" height="321" /></a>

When you hover over any row you want to look through, it automatically highlights for more convenient user experience:

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/235-4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/235-4.png" alt="HR table 2" width="800" height="187" /></a>

In the row called “Hired” you are able to see all the employees, which were hired during each month: their names and departments. E.g.:

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/235-5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1011" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/235-5.png" alt="hired table" width="800" height="91" /></a>

So you may see, that in September of 2015 company hired 3 persons to HR department.

“Hired count” row displays the information about the total number of employees hired in a certain period of time:

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/235-6.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/235-6.png" alt="hired table 2" width="800" height="115" /></a>

For example, as you may see here, in September of 2015 total number of hired workers is 3.

“Fired” row, respectfully, gives you information about who and from which department was fired in a certain month:

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/235-7.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1014" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/235-7.png" alt="fired table" width="800" height="142" /></a>

This screenshot, for instance, shows that in September of 2015 one employee from HR department was fired.

“Fired counts” row provides you with the total number of employees fired in the period of time the column displays:

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/235-8.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1015" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/235-8.png" alt="fired table 2" width="800" height="164" /></a>

As you may see on the example, dashboard shows, that in September of 2015 total number of fired employees equals to 1.

The last row of the HrDashboard, called “Hired Total” refers to the overall number of employees working or having worked in the company at a certain period of time:

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/235-9.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1016" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/235-9.png" alt="hired total table" width="800" height="188" /></a>

At the example you may see, that the total number of employees working in the company for the September of 2015 is 2 (3 hired and 1 fired).

Thanks to its features, HrDashboard of EasyERP is a simple, convenient and intuitively understandable tool for monitoring the overall situation with the staff of an enterprise. It allows you to see a lot of information at the only one screen.
