One more important issue, while running a business efficiently, is the effective management of leads and opportunities. These are two key issues of successful sales of your company’s products. Keeping up on leads and opportunities will benefit you a lot, as a good businessperson should always know the interest to the products of his or her company and be able to use it skillfully.

Leads represent an interest to your products or services expressed by potential customers. As soon as you get information from your partner about a person interested in your products, someone has registered at your website or left his  contact information, you get a potential customer. From this point you and your staff can use this data to get a new customer for your company.

<strong><u>Leads menu screen</u></strong> of EasyERP is a tool specially created for you to manage all the leads you have efficiently. With the help of EasyERP’s leads you get an instrument to turn a potential customer into an actual one.

Here you may view a full list of available leads and see detailed information about each of them: from contact information of a customer to lead’s stage and priority. Also users may add new lead, delete unneeded items, edit information about existing ones.

When creating a new lead, you can insert all the data needed: information about a potential client and lead (subject, company’s and person’s contact information), set the status of lead: whether it’s a draft, open, closed, cancelled or one being in progress, priority of the lead, campaign, which has brought a lead (email, newsletter, web or telesales), etc.

With the “Leads” menu you gain a possibility to convey most of your leads into opportunities and manage all of the possibilities effortless.

Opportunities are the “evolution” of leads. While leads are interest to your products, opportunities are the biggest and most profitable possibilities for your sales. From the moment a client expresses interest in cooperation with you or in purchasing your service or product - you get an opportunity.

Manage all your opportunities with the help of “Opportunities” menu of “Sales” module. It provides you with the section, where you may enter and manage information about an opportunity, keep it up-to-date, analyze and set stages of it.

To each opportunity you may insert all the data needed: starting of expected revenues and terms up to information about assignees and customers. Also you may attach files and add notes to each lead.

Highly informative, intelligible and comfortable kanban board view will enhance your experience of working with the opportunities; a list view is also available.
