Handling clear and accurate accounting is one of the most important points when talking about a successful business. Each CEO, owner or manager should always be aware of all the income and expenses of their company or department to keep it liquid and profitable, as negative balance sooner or later will destroy the company. Suchwise constant control over the accounting is one of the crucial issues in business: good manager always must keep abreast of the finances, monitor and oversee the money gained and spent.

For this sake, EasyERP offers you the “Accounting” menu, where you will be able to see all the financial activities of the company: money sent to suppliers and payments received from customers are displayed in the list.

You may sort items of the list according to your needs: by date, number, reference, partner, journal, total amount of currency or status. Thanks to this it is easy  to monitor and track all the incoming and outcoming payments of the enterprise.
