“Birthdays” section of “HR” menu helps you to keep up on the birthdays of all the employees of the company.

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/116-4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-887" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/116-4.png" alt="birthdays menu" width="800" height="350" /></a>

Here birthdays that are to take place at the current and next week, and current month are displayed.

You may see an employee (his or her name, position, department and photo), who is having a birthday soon. Date of birthday and age are shown near a row with the information about the employee:

You may view employee’s profile for more detailed information by pressing  button located at row’s end. This action will open employee’s profile.

Note, that there are no data available for editing in “Birthdays” menu, as here you are able only to view it. Therefore, if you want to change some information, you have to do it via “Employees” menu or profile of an employee.
