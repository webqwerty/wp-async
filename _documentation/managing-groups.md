The first tool to customize the system you face in the settings menu of EasyERP is a section to manage groups.

Here a you are able to see a derivative list of all the departments within the company, which have been created and saved in the database. It is an illustration of a company’s structure, as parent departments are shown first, all departments accountable to this or that parent department derive of it. Thanks to this, it is an intuitive and simple tool for you not only to see the structure of the company, but also to edit and configure groups just as you need.

All the settings applied to each department will reflect your experience of operating with such features as, for example, working with HR, when you create employees, applications or job positions, you choose a group, to which they are related, from the list of groups that are already in the database. Correspondingly, groups may be configured in this section of “Settings” menu.

You may easily change position of each item in the overall list with the help of drag and drop (derived groups will automatically change position with a parent one).

Note, when you start working with EasyERP this list will be empty, as groups should at first be created by users.

<strong>Creating a new Group</strong>

	<li>Department Name - textfield to enter the name of a department. Department name cannot be empty and should consist at least of two characters.</li>
	<li>Parent Department - choose a parent department for a newly created group from the list of departments that are already in the database. If no parent department required, this field may be left empty.</li>

<ol start="4">
	<li>Create - pressing this button you will create the new group with all the information given above.</li>
</ol>
Cancel - after pressing this button all the information given above will be lost and the group will not be created.

<strong>Viewing and editing group’s data</strong>

Clicking on any item in the list of groups brings you to the group’s window, where you may look through and edit main and second information about an existing group.

Also this window may be opened by clicking “Edit” button , which becomes visible when hovering over an item in the list. This button is located at the end of item’s row.

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/311-5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1050" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/311-5.png" alt="group bar" width="800" height="20" /></a>

If you have edited any data, changes may be confirmed or cancelled by clicking an appropriate button ("Save" of "Cancel") at the group’s window.

<strong>Delete a group</strong>

You may delete a group either by clicking “Delete” button , located at the end of item’s row in the overall list. Note, this button becomes visible when hovering over an item.

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/311-5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1050" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/311-5.png" alt="group bar" width="800" height="20" /></a>

Also it is possible to remove a group through group’s window by clicking on an item in the list and pressing the “Delete” button  there.

In both cases, after user has pressed “Delete” button, an alert message appears, where one may confirm or cancel the action.
