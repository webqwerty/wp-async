<ol start="3">
	<li>Create - pressing this button you will create a new user profile with all the information given above.</li>
</ol>
Cancel - after pressing this button all the information given above will be lost and a user profile will not be created.

<strong>View and edit user’s data</strong>

In case one has the appropriate access level, he or she may open profile of each user, where it is possible to look through and edit user’s information.

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/321-3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1055" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/321-3.png" alt="view user data" width="600" height="227" /></a>

To open a profile of any user click on the item in the overall list of users and the page will be redirected to a user’s profile.

In the profile’s screen you may find the “Edit” button , located in the top left corner of the screen. With its help you may open a window for editing some profile data, namely you can change the avatar, user’s name, email, profile’s type.

You may save or dismiss changes in profile information by clicking the appropriate button ("Save" of "Cancel").

<strong>Delete a user</strong>

You may delete already existing users from the database if you need to. This action may be completed in a few ways.

<em><u>First possible variant</u></em> is to choose one or several users to be deleted from the overall list using checkboxes:

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/321-4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1056" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/321-4.png" alt="checkboxes" width="800" height="19" /></a>

When you have chosen the items, the “Delete” button <strong>x </strong>appears at the top left corner of the screen, next to “Add” button. Pressing this button you may delete selected items.

Note, that multiple deletion is available only through the overall list of users.

<em><u>Second way</u></em> to remove a single (unlike deleting via overall list, where multiple selection is allowed) user from the database is to press the “Delete” button <strong>x</strong> in profile screen. The button is located next to the “Add” button in the top left corner of the screen.

<a href="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/321-5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1057" src="https://easyerp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/321-5.png" alt="delete user" width="800" height="124" /></a>

<em><u>The third possible variant</u></em> is to delete a user via editing window. To remove user from a database in such a way, click "Delete" button in editing mode. This button is located near the “Save” and “Cancel” buttons.

In all cases, after you have pressed “Delete” button, the alert message appears, where you may confirm or cancel the action.
